# Terraform Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress and learning through a comprehensive Terraform course. It includes code examples, projects, and exercises covering everything from basic infrastructure as code concepts to advanced state management and modularization.

## What I Learned in This Course

Throughout this repository, I have explored the core concepts of Terraform, including:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Fundamentals**: Understanding the benefits of codified infrastructure.
- **Terraform Basics**: Mastering the syntax, HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), and basic commands.
- **State Management**: Handling local and remote backends to manage infrastructure state effectively.
- **Resource Management**: Creating, updating, and destroying resources across multiple providers.
- **Data Sources**: Querying and using existing infrastructure data within configurations.
- **Variables and Outputs**: Making configurations dynamic and reusable with input variables, locals, and output values.
- **Expressions and Functions**: Utilizing built-in functions and expressions for complex logic.
- **Modules**: Organizing code into reusable modules for better maintainability.
- **Project Structure**: Implementing practical projects like IAM user management.
- **Advanced State Operations**: Moving, importing, and manipulating state files directly.
- **Validation**: Implementing input validation to ensure robust configurations.
